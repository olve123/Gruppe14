For over 100 years this has been the country's main stage and was open 1 september 1899. Which was a venue for plays, grand celebrations and lots of other traditional and innovative happenings. After independence from Sweden did Norway start with building up the nation and of course the Norwegians had a desire to have something in theater for playwrights and artists. Henrik bull was the architect behind nationaltheatret, we find statue of both Bjornson and Ibsen outside nationaltheatret to show that this was something Norwegian and we here in the country can be proud of.
